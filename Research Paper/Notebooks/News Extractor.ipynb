      "Tesla Inc. boss Elon Musk delivered a one-two punch for anyone betting on cobalt to continue its record-breaking rally, and some good news for nickel fans.\n",
      "\n",
      "The maker of electric vehicles said in a letter to shareholders it has slashed its reliance on cobalt for its Model 3 vehicle, while raising nickel content, and that its latest batteries already employ less cobalt than similar types already on the market. On a conference call with analysts, Musk went further.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We think we can get cobalt to almost nothing,” the carmaker’s chief executive officer said in response to a question on reducing battery costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cobalt prices have exploded to the highest in a decade as companies including Tesla strive to bring electric vehicles into the mainstream, with supply largely dependent on a few mines in the politically volatile Democratic Republic of Congo. Nickel, which has gained about 50 percent over the same two-year span, is more widely available and, for now, cheaper. A shift to nickel-rich batteries is happening faster than expected, according to BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s biggest miner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla has worked on reducing cobalt usage “for literally several years now, and this has been extremely helpful in the overall cost per kilowatt hour, especially with recent commodity price movements,” Jeffrey Straubel, Tesla’s chief technology officer, said on the call.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the weight of its Model 3 is on par with gasoline-powered counterparts, its battery cells are of the highest energy density used in any electric vehicle, the Palo Alto, California-based company said Wednesday in the letter. “We have achieved this by significantly reducing cobalt content per battery pack while increasing nickel content and still maintaining superior thermal stability,” Tesla said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesla says the cobalt content in its nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathode chemistry is already lower than next-generation cathodes that will be made by other cell producers with a nickel-manganese-cobalt ratio of 8:1:1.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The incentive is for chemists to reduce costs as much as possible, and that’s what’s happening right now,” Ken Hoffman, client development executive at McKinsey & Co., said in an interview in Shanghai in April. “It’s the old adage that high prices is the cure for high prices.”\n",

      "The earnings report started optimistically enough, with Elon Musk forecasting an end to Tesla Inc.’s cash-burning days after blazing through another $1 billion last quarter. But by the end of Tesla’s first-quarter conference call, Musk was berating analysts for asking “boring” questions, the shares had plunged and any shred of predictability was out the window. … Musk cut off analysts’ queries about the company’s capital requirements and whether it was retaining Model 3 reservation holders, calling the questions “so dry” and “not cool.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And:\n",
      "\n",
      "“And so where specifically will you be in terms of capital requirements?” Sacconaghi said. “Excuse me. Next. Next,” Musk said to the call operator. “Boring, bonehead questions are not cool. Next?”\n",
      "\n",
      "And:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think that if people are concerned about volatility, they should definitely not buy our stock,” Musk replied. “I’m not here to convince you to buy our stock. Do not buy it if volatility is scary. There you go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Look, I mean, it’s a theory. Obviously shareholders of a public company get—or at least want—some say in choosing their managers. But the managers get—or at least want—some say in choosing their shareholders, too. If you are not cool with Musk, you probably shouldn’t invest in Tesla, and if Musk doesn’t think you’re cool, he could perfectly reasonably try to drive you away from investing in Tesla. Obviously there are a lot of very traditional normal investors in Tesla who like Musk fine as a visionary but would find it helpful if he’d answer basic financial questions on the conference call, but you can’t get everything you want, and there is something rather likable about Musk forcing them to choose. Anyway if Tesla does blow up you can’t say there weren’t any hints.\n",

      "Elsewhere, Mark Pincus of Zynga Inc. is converting his high-vote stock into low-vote stock, apparently out of the goodness of his heart:\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Pincus said, he made the decision in consultation with Zynga’s board, partly because of growing criticism of dual- and multiclass share structures. As part of the change, Mr. Pincus said, he will leave Zynga as an employee — he was executive chairman — and become nonexecutive chairman of the company’s board of directors. “We think the company doesn’t benefit anymore from a multiclass structure,” Mr. Pincus said.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is some loose sense in which, even in companies with multiple share classes that are controlled by their charismatic founders, those founders still owe a fiduciary duty to the company and its shareholders. The point of the dual-class share structure is to give the founder more freedom to act in the long-term interests of the company, free from the short-term pressures of a myopic stock market. (If you believe that.) At some point—for instance, when the charismatic founder is no longer that involved in the day-to-day running of the company and wants to focus on other things—then he should, as a long-term shareholder acting in the best interests of the company, probably just voluntarily give up the dual-class structure. Still you don’t see it very often.\n",

      "A few hours after Elon Musk berated analysts for what he perceived as unimaginative questions, Volkswagen AG said it was writing a check for batteries that almost match Tesla Inc.’s entire market value.\n",
      "\n",
      "VW has awarded 40 billion euros ($48 billion) in contracts to battery producers, double from just a few weeks ago. The deals take the German manufacturer within striking distance of its target to lock down 50 billion euros in supplies. By 2025, VW plans to sell as many as 3 million all-electric cars per year, Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess told investors Thursday at the annual shareholder meeting in Berlin.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Musk has perfected the role as industry iconoclast, he’s finding himself increasingly on the defensive as investors probe Tesla’s finances and established manufacturers from Daimler AG to VW push aggressively into his niche. VW makes more cars in four days than Tesla does in a year, and is harnessing its immense financial and engineering firepower to make up for ground lost in a self-inflicted diesel-cheating scandal.\n",

      "“I could not be more bullish on German premium luxury business,” Mike Jackson, CEO of U.S. dealership chain AutoNation Inc., said on a conference call this week. “They have the best pipeline I’ve ever seen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The battery investment by VW -- the world’s largest carmaker with Porsche, Audi and Bentley under its umbrella -- was prompted in part by the manufacturer’s own missteps. European diesel sales have fallen off rapidly since VW admitted cheating on emissions tests in 2015, forcing carmakers in the market to accelerate their rollout of electrified vehicles in order to meet coming EU carbon-dioxide limits on engines.\n",
      "\n",
      "VW’s announcement comes a day after Tesla CEO Musk renewed concerns about the electric carmaker’s ability to hit production targets and conserve cash. During Wednesday’s conference call, he criticized analysts for asking “boring” questions and cut off queries about the company’s capital needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By 2020 we will offer our customers more than 25 new electric models and more than 20 plug-in hybrids,” Diess said. “In just a few years’ time, then, across all brands and regions, we aim to put the world’s largest fleet of electric vehicles on the road.”\n",
      "\n",
      "VW’s Audi brand, the group’s largest earnings contributor, will start production of its first all-electric SUV at the end of August, followed by the four-door coupe Mission E from sister brand Porsche next year. VW’s namesake brand will start to roll out the new I.D. range of battery-powered vehicles from 2020, which will be priced at comparable levels to similar combustion engine vehicles.\n",

      "As carmakers roll out their electric lineups, Diess said there were “clear” need to revive talks over joint battery cell production in Europe to satisfy growing demand.
